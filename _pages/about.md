## About Me

I will join the Computer Science department at the **Washington State University (WSU)** as an tenure track assistant professor from Fall 2023. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lei Ying](https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/) in Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/). My research interests lie in designing scalable, theoretical and practical machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.

## To Prospective Students

- **I am looking for highly motivated students with strong  backgrounds in matthematics, reinforcement learning, machine learning and optimization to work with me.**

- **Moreover, intern and visiting students are highly welcome!**

> Please send me an email (honghaow at umich dot edu) if you are interested in working with me. Please include your resume, undergraduate/graduate transcripts.

## Research

My major research interests include:

- Online Learning and Decision-making
- Reinforcement Learning and Constrained Reinforcement Learning
- Stochastic Modeling, Analysis and Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning with Applications in Communication, Ride-hailing Networks, and Social Networks
