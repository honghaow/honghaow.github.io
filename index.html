<h2>About me
</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Washington State University (WSU).</a> I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>, 2023, advised by <a href="https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Lei Ying.</a> My research interests lie in designing scalable, efficient, and practical machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.
